## FindIndex
This code is designed to compare the performance of CPU and GPU searching for a target value within an array of integers. The command-line arguments allow you to customize the execution parameters, such as the number of CPU threads, CUDA threads per block, and the size of the array. The code also provides options to display program information and usage.
